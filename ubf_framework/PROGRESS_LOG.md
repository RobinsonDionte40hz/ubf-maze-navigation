  - 14-field memory structure with significance calculation
  - Quantum-inspired consolidation
  - Memory retrieval based on relevance
  - Max 50 memories per agent with decay

- **Decision System**

- **Consciousness Update Service**
  - Event-driven coordinate updates
  - 17 event types (success, failure, learning, social, etc.)
  - Noise injection for natural variation
  - Enhanced failure learning with creativity boost

### Phase 2: Simulation Environment ✅
- **Maze Environment**
  - DFS-based maze carving algorithm
  - Configurable maze dimensions (tested with 8x8, 10x10, 11x11)
  - Triangular line-of-sight system
  - Agent position tracking and collision detection
  - Wall density: ~60-65%

- **Agent Integration**
  - Position and orientation tracking
  - Action history logging
  - Experience sharing between agents
  - Goal-directed navigation

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation ✅
- **Test Scenarios**
  - Solo runs (3 iterations)
  - Experienced + 2 new agents
  - 3 fresh agents
  - 500 steps maximum per scenario

- **Performance Profiling**
  - SIMD batching hints for scaling
  - Swarm optimization support
  - JSON result serialization

### Phase 4: Bug Fixes & Optimization ✅

#### Critical Bugs Fixed
1. **Division by Zero in Consciousness Evolution Analysis**
   - Issue: Empty evolution_patterns list caused crash
   - Fix: Added conditional checks before averaging
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

2. **Agent Navigation Failure (0% Success Rate)**
   - Issue: Agents not moving effectively through mazes
   - Root Causes Identified:
     - Excessive turning actions (75% of actions)
     - Creative_solution spam (always available when obstacles present)
     - Environmental suitability penalizing movement due to maze obstacles
     - No goal-directed movement bonuses

#### Optimization Improvements

**Iteration 1: Environmental Context Enhancement**
- Added `distance_to_goal` field
- Added `moving_toward_goal` boolean
- Implemented directional calculation relative to agent orientation
- Result: Context now provides goal navigation hints

**Iteration 2: Action Weight Adjustment**
- Boosted `move_forward` base weight: 1.0 → 2.0 (when toward goal)
- Reduced turning weights: 0.8 → 0.4
- Lowered `goal_alignment` for turning actions
- Restricted `creative_solution` to stuck_count > 2
- Reduced `investigate` base weight
- Result: Still too much turning (random seed issue in testing)

**Iteration 3: Decision System Refinement**
- **Goal Priority Factor:** Added +12.0 bonus for goal-directed movement
- **Environmental Suitability:** 
  - Reduced obstacle penalty from 100% to 30%
  - Added 2.5x multiplier for goal-directed movement
  - Adjusted terrain difficulty impact
- Result: **SUCCESS - 33.3% completion rate**

### Phase 5: Visualization System ✅

**ASCII Animation (No Dependencies)**
- Real-time terminal-based visualization
- Live agent tracking with direction indicators
- Path visualization (visited cells)
- Info panel with consciousness metrics
- Configurable animation speed
- Completion summary with success rates

**2D Matplotlib Visualization (Optional)**
- Colorful maze rendering
- Agent trails with transparency
- Direction arrows on agents
- Legend and info panels
- Smooth animation support
- Snapshot export capability

**Features:**
- Multiple agent support (different colors/symbols)
- Live consciousness metric display
- Distance to goal tracking
- Completion detection and summary
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Files Created:**
- `visualize_ascii.py` - Terminal-based animation
- `visualize_2d.py` - Matplotlib graphical visualization
- `VISUALIZATION_README.md` - Complete visualization guide

### Phase 6: Current Performance Metrics

#### Test Results (Latest Run)
```
Solo Phase (3 runs):
  - Run 1: 0% success (500 steps)
  - Run 2: 0% success (500 steps)
  - Run 3: 0% success (500 steps)
  - Average: 0% success

Group 1 (Experienced + 2 New):
  - Success Rate: 33.3% (1/3 agents)
  - Completion: new_agent_0 finished at step 250
  - Total Steps: 500

Group 2 (3 New Agents):
  - Success Rate: 33.3% (1/3 agents)
  - Completion: fresh_agent_2 finished at step 450
  - Total Steps: 500

Overall: 2 out of 6 agents completed mazes (33.3%)
```

#### Key Observations
- Group scenarios outperform solo runs (33% vs 0%)
- Social learning/experience sharing may provide benefits
- Agents complete mazes between steps 250-450
- Consciousness coordinates remain relatively stable during navigation
- Memory formation currently low (0 memories in test runs)

## Lessons Learned
1. **Complex systems need iterative debugging** - Multiple factors interact in decision-making
2. **Context is crucial** - Environmental hints dramatically improve navigation
3. **Base weights aren't everything** - Decision system calculations can override them
4. **Random seeds affect testing** - Need varied test scenarios for proper validation
5. **Goal-directed bonuses work** - Explicit goal navigation boosts effective movement
